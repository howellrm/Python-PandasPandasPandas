    "Hints and Considerations\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "    <li>These are challenging activities for a number of reasons. For one, these activities will require you to analyze thousands of records. Hacking through the data to look for obvious trends in Excel is just not a feasible option. The size of the data may seem daunting, but Python Pandas will allow you to efficiently parse through it.</li>\n",
    "\n",
    "    <li>Second, these activities will also challenge you by requiring you to learn on your feet. Don't fool yourself into thinking: \"I need to study Pandas more closely before diving in.\" Get the basic gist of the library and then immediately get to work. When facing a daunting task, it's easy to think: \"I'm just not ready to tackle it yet.\" But that's the surest way to never succeed. Learning to program requires one to constantly tinker, experiment, and learn on the fly. You are doing exactly the right thing, if you find yourself constantly practicing Google-Fu and diving into documentation. There is just no way (or reason) to try and memorize it all. \n",
    "        Online references are available for you to use when you need them. So use them!</li>\n",
    "\n",
    "    <li>Take each of these tasks one at a time. Begin your work, answering the basic questions: \"How do I import the data?\" \"How do I convert the data into a DataFrame?\" \"How do I build the first table?\" Don't get intimidated by the number of asks. Many of them are repetitive in nature with just a few tweaks. Be persistent and creative!'</li>\n",
    "\n",
    "    <li>Expect these exercises to take time! Don't get discouraged if you find yourself spending hours initially with little progress. Force yourself to deal with the discomfort of not knowing and forge ahead. This exercise is likely to take between 15-30 hours of your time. Consider these hours an investment in your future!'</li>\n",
    "\n",
    "    <li>As always, feel encouraged to work in groups and get help from your TAs and Instructor. Just remember, true success comes from mastery and not a completed homework assignment. So challenge yourself to truly succeed!</li>\n",
